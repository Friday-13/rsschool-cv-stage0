## About Me

Beginner Python developer.
I started my career as a software developer for microcontrollers. Now I'm trying to change this sphere of IT to Web-development.

I'm looking for a job as a Python developer and I'm trying to develop in backend development, but I'm also interested in studying the basics of frontend development.
I like to learn new technologies. Developing and gaining new experience in IT is what brings me real pleasure. And I am really glad  when I can see the result of my work - new program or feature of program, that can do something new, something useful.

I am responsible, I work well in a team and can organize my working time. I always try to find a common language with any project participant and I don't afraid to master some new skills.

## Skills

- Python3
  - Django
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
- SQL
- C
  - STM32-programming
- LaTeX

## Code Example

- [LeetCode: 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        if not list1:
            return list2

        if not list2:
            return list1

        head1 = list1
        head2 = list2
        new_head = ListNode()
        current_node = None
        if head1.val <= head2.val:
            new_head.val = head1.val
            head1 = head1.next
        else:
            new_head.val = head2.val
            head2 = head2.next

        current_node = new_head

        while head1 and head2:
            if head1.val <= head2.val:
                current_node.next = head1
                head1 = head1.next
            else:
                current_node.next = head2
                head2 = head2.next
            current_node = current_node.next

        if head1:
            current_node.next = head1
        if head2:
            current_node.next = head2

        return new_head
```

- Handler realisation for average filter with excluding extremums

```c
void ExclAverFilterHandler(ExclAverFilterStruct *Signal)
{
    Signal->SampleFreqCount++;
    if (Signal->SampleFreqCount >= Signal->SampleFreq)
    {
        Signal->SampleFreqCount = 0;
        Signal->SampleCount++;
        Signal->Sum += Signal->Value;
        /*Search extremums for exclude*/
        if (Signal->MaxValue < Signal->Value)
        {
            Signal->MaxValue = Signal->Value;
        }
        if (Signal->MinValue > Signal->Value)
        {
            Signal->MinValue = Signal->Value;
        }
        if (Signal->SampleCount >= Signal->SampleSize)
        {
            Signal->Out = (Signal->Sum - Signal->MaxValue - Signal->MinValue) / (Signal->SampleCount - 2);
            Signal->SampleCount = 0;
            Signal->Sum = 0;
            Signal->MinValue = UINT16_MAX;
            Signal->MaxValue = 0;
            Signal->Filtered = 1;
        }
    }
}
```
